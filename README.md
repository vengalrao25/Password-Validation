# Password validation
Password validation helps prevent unauthorized access to user accounts by requiring users to create strong and unique passwords. Strong passwords are more difficult for hackers to crack, and unique passwords for each account help prevent a single compromised password from affecting multiple accounts. By validating passwords, websites can enforce password complexity rules, such as requiring a minimum length or a combination of upper and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
